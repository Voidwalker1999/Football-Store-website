                        <p>Football (also known as association football or soccer) is a team
                            sport played between two teams of 11 players each. It is widely
                            considered to be the most popular sport in the world. A ball game, it
                            is played on a rectangular grass field, or occasionally an artificial
                            turf, with a goal at each end of the field. The object of the game is to
                            score by manoeuvring the ball into the opposing goal; only the
                            goalkeepers may use their hands or arms to propel the ball in general
                            play. The team that scores the most goals by the end of the match
                            wins. If the score is tied at the end of the game, either a draw is
                            declared or the game goes into extended time, depending on the
                            format of the competition.
                            The modern game was codified in England following the formation
                            of the Football Association, whose 1863 Laws of the Game created
                            the foundations for the way the sport is played today. Football is governed internationally by
                            Fédération Internationale de
                            Football Association (FIFA). The most prestigious international football competition is the World
                            Cup, held every four years.
                            This event, the most widely viewed and famous in the world, boasts twice the audience of the Summer
                            Olympics.

                    <div class="card">
                        <p>Games revolving around the kicking of a ball have been played in many
                            countries throughout history. According to FIFA, the "very earliest form of
                            the game for which there is scientific evidence was an exercise of precisely
                            this skilful technique dating back to the 2nd and 3rd centuries B.C. in China."
                            In addition, the Roman games Harpastum may be a distant ancestor of
                            football. Various forms of football were played in medieval Europe, though rules varied greatly by both period and location.
                            Whilst football has continued to be played in various forms throughout Britain, the English public schools (fee-paying
                            schools) are widely credited with certain key achievements in the creation of modern football (association football and the
                            rugby football games - rugby league and rugby union football). The evidence suggests that during the sixteenth century
                            English public schools generally, and headmaster Richard Mulcaster in particular, were instrumental in taking football away
                            from its violent " mob" form and turning it into an organized team sport that was beneficial to schoolboys. Therefore, the
                            game became institutionalised, regulated, and part of a larger, more central tradition.

                        <p>Football is played in accordance with a set of rules, known as the Laws of the
                            Game. The game is played using a single round ball (the football) and two
                            teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into the other team's
                            goal, thereby scoring a goal. The team that has scored more goals at the end
                            of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of
                            goals, then the game is a draw. There are exceptions to this rule, however; see
                            Duration and tie-breaking methods below.
                            The primary rule is that the players (other than the goalkeepers) may not
                            intentionally touch the ball with their hands or arms during play (though they
                            do use their hands during a throw-in restart). Although players usually use
                            their feet to move the ball around, they may use any part of their bodies other
                            than their hands or arms.
                            In typical game play, players attempt to propel the ball toward their opponents' goal through individual control of the ball,
                            such as by dribbling, passing the ball to a team-mate, and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing
                            goalkeeper.

                            who controls the ball; however, physical contact between opponents is limited.
